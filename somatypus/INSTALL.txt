INSTALLING SOMATYPUS
v1.1


Somatypus has been designed as a set of Bash and Python scripts that do not require a real 
installation, but simply adding the software directory to the PATH environment variable, 
thus making set-up straightforward. However, it has some minimal software dependencies:

 • Python 2.6 or later (not tested on Python 3.X), including development libraries.

 • Platypus (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus), which in turn requires htslib 
   (http://www.htslib.org), which in turn requires zlib (http://zlib.net).

 • VCFtools (https://vcftools.github.io), for using the vcf-sort command.

 • The tabix package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/tabix), for using the 
   tabix and bgzip commands. It should come together with htslib.


For the sake of tidiness, it is advisable to create a folder called "somatypus" in the
location where you usually install software, and install all the dependencies and the
Somatypus pipeline itself (the somatypus-x.x folder) into it.


The following instructions assume that you have administrator privileges in the system 
you are using (i.e. that you can do "sudo"); otherwise, you should contact you system's
administrator. Although it should be obvious, please note that you need to replace things
like "path/to/" and "/*FULL/PATH/TO*/" with the actual path to the relevant folder.
"/*FULL/PATH/TO*/" indicates that the absolute path (beginning at "/", e.g. /home/user/...)
must be used.


The recommended installation order is:


 1. Python >=2.6
    Python is normally installed by default in most UNIX systems. However, in order to 
    run Platypus, you need to install the Python development libraries.
    On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install them with:
    
        sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
    On RPM-based Linux distributions, you can install them with:
    
        sudo yum install python-devel


 2. zlib (development files)
    If you have trouble installing htslib (below), you probably need to install this first.
    On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install the corresponding package with:
    
        sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
        
    On RPM-based Linux distributions, you can install it with:
    
        sudo yum install zlib-devel


 3. htslib
    This is necessary in order to run Platypus.
    Latest version as of April 2016: 
    https://github.com/samtools/htslib/releases/download/1.3/htslib-1.3.tar.bz2

    Once downloaded and uncompressed, you can install it with:
    
        cd path/to/htslib-x.x
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
    
    After this, you need to add the htslib directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
    variable. You can do this either by editing your ~/.bashrc file with a text editor 
    (e.g. nano) and adding the following line:
    
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/*FULL/PATH/TO*/htslib-x.x:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
    Or just by appending the relevant line to the file with:
    
        cd path/to/htslib-x.x
        echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
       
    Either way, it is then necessary to source the .bashrc file for the changes to be 
    applied:
    
        source ~/.bashrc


 4. Platypus
    This is the best and the worst part of the pipeline.
    Latest version: http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/software-download-registration

    Once downloaded and uncompressed, you can install it with:
    
        cd path/to/Platypus_x.x.x
        ./buildPlatypus.sh
    
    If installation is successful, you will see the message "Finished building Platypus".
    After this, you need to make a symbolic link to the Platypus executable file in the
    somatypus-x.x/src folder (which will be then added to the PATH variable, see below).
    
        cd path/to/Platypus_x.x.x
        ln -s $PWD/Platypus.py path/to/somatypus-x.x/src/


 5. VCFtools
    On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install the corresponding package with:
    
        sudo apt-get install vcftools
        
    On RPM-based Linux distributions, you can install it with:
    
        sudo yum install vcftools
    

 6. Somatypus
    The last step is adding the Somatypus directory to your PATH environment variable, so
    that the somatypus command can be called from the command line. You can do this either
    by editing your ~/.bashrc file with a text editor (e.g. nano) and adding the line:
    
        export PATH=/*FULL/PATH/TO*/somatypus-x.x/src:$PATH
    
    Or just by appending the relevant line to the file with:
    
        cd path/to/somatypus-x.x
        echo "export PATH=$PWD/src:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
       
    Either way, it is then necessary to source the .bashrc file for the changes to be 
    applied:
    
        source ~/.bashrc


Once all the dependencies and the pipeline have been installed, you should be able to run 
all of the following commands (which show the usage information of each tool):

    Platypus.py callVariants -h
    tabix
    bgzip
    vcf-sort -h
    somatypus


And now you can have fun.
