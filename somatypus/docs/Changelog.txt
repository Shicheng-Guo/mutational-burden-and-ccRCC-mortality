# Change Log

## [1.3] - 2016-12-

### Added
- If the user does not provide a set of target regions for variant calling, a set
  of regions is defined for genotyping that includes a region of +/- 200 bp around
  each of the (filtered) called variants. This is done in order to speed up
  genotyping in whole genomes.

### Changed
- Quality filtering for called/genotyped indels has been modified, so that 
  filtering based on Platypus quality flags is done in the same manner as for SNVs.
- Documentation updated.


## [1.2.1] - 2016-09-21

### Changed

- 'SNP' changed to 'SNV' in all the intermediate file names, and in script names.
- Other minor changes in scripts.
- Documentation updated.


## [1.2] - 2016-05-14

### Added
- Somatypus_MergeIndelRegions.py script, which merges overlapping regions from the 
  regions file used for re-genotyping indels that are missing after genotyping.

### Changed
- Indels are now genotyped separately in an additional pipeline step (#12). This
  solves a problem that caused a small proportion of variant calls to be duplicated.
- Indices of steps after #11 have been updated after the inclusion of indel 
  genotyping.
- Intermediate region files called 'SNPregions_...' renamed to 'varRegions_...'.
- Somatypus_VafFilter.py script no longer performs filtering of indels according to 
  quality flags, or separation of SNPs and indels.
- Somatypus_ExtractExons.py script renamed to Somatypus_ExtractRegions.py.
- Somatypus_SNPs_final.vcf output file renamed to Somatypus_SNVs_final.vcf.
- Slightly different naming of genotyping log files.
- Output files are now sorted by chromosome in natural order: 
  1,2,...,10,11,...,20,21,...,X instead of 1,10,11,...,2,20,21,...,X
- Documentation updated.


##Â [1.1] - 2016-04-15

### Added
- Command-line option -p for specifying additional Platypus arguments.
- Subsequent Somatypus executions with the same output folder (to resume execution) 
  generate different global log files, labeled with date and time.
- Individual variant calling generates a separate log file for each sample.

### Changed
- Temporary folders and log files naming convention, so that the numbers in
  the folder/file names match those of the step(s) involved.
- Detailed installation steps in INSTALL.txt.
- Command-line usage information.
- Other minor changes to the somatypus script.
- Documentation updated.

### Removed
- Installation script (more dangerous than useful).
