# Description of VCF file
 

_somatic.vcf_ file contains somatic mutations for clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC).

Paired samples from tumor and normal (health) tissues were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform.

The germline variation was ruled out by comparison with tumour detected variation. A total of 9,220 somatic SNV were observed. INDEL variants were discarded in the filtering processes.
