# Description of VCF file
 

somatic.vcf was the file were somatic mutations for clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) was reported. Ten patients were included in this study, whose paired samples from the tumour and normal (health) tissues were sequenced with Ion Torrent platform. The germline variation was ruled out by compairing with tumour detected variation, obtaining a total of 9,220 SNVs with somatic origin. All the indels were discarded in the filtering processes. 

In this file, users will be able to find the genotypes corresponding to each patient and to each reported somatic variant. The genotypes are indicated in 10 columns, where the header indicates the corresponding patient accompanied by T (tumor).
